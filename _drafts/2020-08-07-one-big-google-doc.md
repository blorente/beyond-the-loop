The title says it all, really.

**I keep all my notes, plan most of my projects, and keep a diary in one big Google Doc**. It's been going on for about two years, and it's grown to about 100 pages.

It's been the most useful way to gather my knowledge about things I learn on the job, to keep track of projects, and even help me debug stuff!

In this post, I'll outline why I've decided to do this, how I've structured my doc over the years, and how it may benefit you!

# What problems does this solve?

Over the years, I've searched for the perfect note-taking system. I want to have the knowledge I have organized and readily accessible. But that's not all I want from my note-taking system.

When coosing a note-taking system, I want:

- To be able to easily find a place to put something.
- To be able to easily guess the place where I put something.
- To be able to add visual resources (images, tables, links...).
- To be able to organize it easily.
- To do that from any device, from anywhere.
- To be able to set reminders to do things.
- To be able to write a diary (very important to keep track of the important points at meetings!)
- To be able to put all the context around a single project, and easily archive that when I'm done with it.
- To be able to write my notes on content that 

I've tried many systems before settling on this one, but they all had their flaws. One Big Google doc, however, fits these perfectly.

Let's see how:

## Open Threads

These are things that I'm expected to comment or act on, but haven't gotten around to yet. Things like:

- Code I need to review.
- Design docuents and tickets I dhould read and give input on.
- Comments I should address on my own code.

Ideally, this list should be empty at the end of each day. Doesn't always happen, but it's a great goal to have.

## The Diary

This contains a daily record and summaries of the meetings I've had and the things I've done during the day.

This record-keeping is tedious, but it serves two major purposes:

- To make sure I don't forget the important points that were made at meetings, or things to follow-up on.
- When the time comes to ask for a promotion, I have a detail record of my contributions that I can use to argument that I've been contributing a lot of value.

Now, that said, I'm not always diligent about keeping a diary. It's a lot of work, and I think I rarely miss many important things at meetings anymore.

However, it's something that helped me greatly when I started, and I pick it back up whenever I'm having a particularly tough time at work.
