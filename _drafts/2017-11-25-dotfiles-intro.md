> The best investment is in the tools of one's own trade. - Benjamin Franklin

We all have to perform repetitive tasks from time to time. Actually, very often. In fact, that's the very reason programmers exist. To automate away the boring stuff.

Yet, too often, I find myself writing the same command line again and again, or looking up the same arguments for a program for the hundredth time.

Whenever that happens, that's a chance to expand my toolbox by automating that boring task. Over the years, my toolbox has grown from one simple bash file into a whole repository's worth of little programs and utilities that I use every day.

The best part of it is that I have never had to dedicate more than 10 minutes to any specific part of my workflow, so the return on productiviy per time invested is enormous.

In this post, I'm going to explain my approach to building my toolbox, why I chose it, and how it can benefit you greatly.

> **Note:** I'm going to assume you're at least familiar with the command line in a Linux or macOS environment. If you're not, there are hundreds of high-quality guides a Google's length away. [This one](https://codeburst.io/your-perfect-kickstart-to-shell-scripting-857b81c0939b), for example.
