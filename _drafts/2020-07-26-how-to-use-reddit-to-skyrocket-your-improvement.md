The single fastest way to become better at something is to learn from people who do it better. This is why having a good mentor and a growth mindset can skyrocket your abilities much faster than they normally would.

However, there will be points in one's life where you can't easily find mentors to learn from. You may have just finished a course or university degree and are on your own. You may just have left a job, or the folks at your current job are not particularly good teachers. Or, on the opposite end, you may be the person who knows the most about whatever you're doing at the moment. That last one is unlikely, but we'll get back to that later.

Whatever the case is, it's not always easy or possible to get the mentorship or feedback we'd like.

Luckily, the internet  offers a myriad of options to get that feedback. It's not as good as a real mentor, but there are still people willing to look at your work with a critical eye and help you improve as much as possible.

In this post, we explore how we can leverage Reddit's communities to skyrocket our programming skill.

## Why Reddit?

TODO: Link to CGPgrey's video.

At its core, Reddit is a place where communities form. These communities, or _subreddits_ revolve around a particular concept. For instance, r/cpp is a community of people that know about the C++ language, r/gamedev is about developing videogames, and r/learnprogramming is about... well... learning how to program.

There is probably a subreddit for everything you can think of, no matter how big or small.

The key concept here is "community". A community is a place where like-minded people get together to talk about something that interests them. This makes it the perfect place to ask questions, and find people who have walked the same path as you. Most communities are very friendly and willing to help, too!

## How Reddit?

Hopefully I've convinced you that Reddit is a valuable asset to have for your career.

Now, how can you leverage the power of these great communities? I've foud that there are three main ways of benefitting from a community: 

- Reading their curated resources lists.
- Seeking feedback from the community.
- Giving feedback to other members.

Let's go one by one.

### Way to use Reddit #1: Using the sidebar as a golden fountain of knowledge

Most subreddits get a lot of beginner questions. Eventually, most of these questions start repeating over time. To help with that, most subreddits have compiled answers and resources in their about pages. The size of the about page depends on the size of the subreddit, with the largest subreddits having fully-fledged wikis! (TODO Link to r/fitness).

> Whenever I want to learn something new, like a new tool or a new language, **my first instinct is to check the sidebar of that subreddit**.

These about pages (also called _sidebar_) have one advantage over Googling things: All of these resources have been useful to real actual humans with the same problems as you're likely to face. Plus, nobody makes any money with these resource lists, so there's no incentive to advertise products that are not genuinely useful.

These lists are pure gold. Whenver a new hobby peaks my interest, the first thing I do is to check the sidebar for that hobby's subreddit. It's the same with programming. Whenever I want to learn something new, like a new tool or a new language, **my first instinct is to check the sidebar of that subreddit**.

If you are wondering "What is the best book to learn Python?" The r/python subreddit has you covered!

### Way to use Reddit #2: Seek feedback from the amazing community

As I said in the begninning, good feedback is the cornerstone of learning. Good feedback is hard to come by, because it requires someone to give you their thought, attention, and careful consideration. The good news is, most subreddits are full of people eager to help!

**Subreddits** can be an amazing resource to get the perspective of someone experienced on your work. There are only two rules that ensure that you have a good interaction with a subreddit:
- **Read the subreddit's rules**. When you post a question or a request for feedback, you are essentialy asking for people's time. Treat that time with respect by reading the rules and doing your best to fulfill them.
- **Put the same effort into presenting the question** as you'd like people to put into writing their answer. If someone wants to help you, you need to give them as many details as possible. Make questions concrete, and give enough context so that the reader doesn't have to go out of their way to understand where you're coming from. A thoughtless question will get a thoughtless answer, and vice versa. (TODO link to question guide from stackoverflow)

> Most subreddits are full of knowledgeable people willing to help. As long as you are respectful of their time, don't be afraid to ask them for answers or feedback!

Note that there was no rule about how experienced you need to be to post a question. Even if it can feel intimidating to post a question and look dumb, it helps to keep in mind that **a moment of looking dumb now can save you months of struggling**. From this perspective, **not posting is much worse** than posting a "dumb question". That said, most subreddits have a mindset of "no question is too dumb", as long as you follow the second rule and put some real effort into asking the question properly So, ask without fear!

Now, there is another great kind of feedback you can get from a subreddit: Code review.
If you're working on a personal project, chances are you're not too sure of what the right way to do something is. **Showing your work** to a subreddit is a great way of getting the feedback you need to ensure you're on the right track.

Here's an example: I made a small weekend project, to learn C++. I posted it in r/cpp_questions, and got some amazing feedback:

<blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created="1595777548"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp_questions/comments/46kfn6/so_i_made_a_chip8_interpreter_as_my_first/">So I made a CHIP-8 Interpreter as my first production-level C++ project, any advice?</a> from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/cpp_questions">r/cpp_questions</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

To recap: Most subreddits are full of knowledgeable people willing to help. As long as you are respectful of their time, don't be afraid to ask them for answers or feedback!

### Way to use Reddit #3: Help people in the subreddit to develop your code reading and communication skills

I hope this doesn't come as a surprise, but there are two skills that differentiate novice programmers from senior engineers:
- Senior engineers can navigate a codebase they've never seen before efficiently without much direction.
- Senior engineers can communicate technical concepts effectively to other engineers of any level.

If someone is seeking people to review their project on Reddit, this is a great opportunity to develop both of those skills!

- Reviewing someone's project forces you to tackle a codebase you've never seen before, so you train your code navigation muscles.
- If you get stuck, you can always go back to the post and ask the author questions or clarification! Chances are they are delighted to answer them (that's why they posted in the first place!).
- Reviewing that code may expose you to techniques and technologies you've never seen before.
- After reviewing someone's code, you need to formulate your feedback in a way that's useful for them. This will train your communication muscles.

On top of it all, you're contributing to the well-being of the community, and helping another fellow programmer, which is always awesome.

Don't be afraid to give your feedback, **especially if you're still starting out**. We all want to write readable code, and your feedback and questions can help the author realize where the author could make their code more approachable!

Sidenote: There is not a lot of good material on learning to approach new codebases, but I'm working on a manual to help with that. If you're interested, subscribe below so that you don't miss out when I announche it.

### Recap

I hope I've convinced you that Reddit is a good place to find growth as a programmer, and given you some useful pointers.

I'd honestly love to hear your experiences with the platform, feel free to contact me at any of the social links below, or leave a comment with your thoughts.
