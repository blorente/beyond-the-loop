Here are some series that I'll keep posting:

- **1% Better**: It doesn't take much to get 1% better as a programmer. However, if we get 1% better two times a week, at the end of the year we'll be twice as good! This series covers tips and tricks that made me 1% better. Short, sweet, easy to read, easy to implement. [See All](../tags/#1%%20Better)

- **Programming Fundamentals**: Programming is primarily a thought process. Learning how to think the right way about it, how to ask the right questions and find out the right answers is the quickest way to get exponentially better. These topics are timeless, and vital for your development as a programmer. [See All](../tags/#Programming%20Fundamentals)

- **Guides and tutorials**: Where we dive into a very specific topic, and we see how to learn, build or use something useful for your career. [See All](../tags/#Guides%20and%20Tutorials)
