Most programming books are manuals, tutorials, or reference materials. These are contextually useful, but most of that information is usually available for free on the internet, so I tend not to buy those.

However, over the years I've found several books that have changed how I look at engineering in a fundamental way. That haven't just taught me JavaScript or C++, but rather **how to be a better engineer**. They also have the benefit of being timeless, so they won't get outdated as easily as <a href="https://amzn.to/32BnZO7">this Java 7 Programming guide</a>.

This is the list of those books, I'd love to hear it if you have more.

### [The Pragmatic Programmer - A. Hunt, D Thomas](https://amzn.to/2ZHcYJ0)

This is the book that brought me from junior programmer to a self-sufficient professional.

It outlines **what's important** and what's not about programming, **how** to spend your time to deliver maximum value, even **how to think** through really hard problems.

The real kicker is that most engineers I deeply respect have similar thought patterns to the ones described in this book. They think similarly about problems, and they are remarkably efficient and insightful in their coding.

I really feel like this book is that knowledge distilled, the next best thing to having a senior engineer to learn from.

If you already know how to code, but are looking to bring yourself to that senior level, this book is for you.

I'm planning to write a full review of this book soon, complete with tips and things to look out for when reading it. Put your email below, so that you don't miss it!
