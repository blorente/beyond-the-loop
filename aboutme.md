My name is **Borja**, and I'm passionate about becoming the best programmer I can be.

If you're like me, and are eager to **level up as an engineer**, this blog is for you.

I've always loved programming. I even studied Computer Science at university. However, it wasn't until I joined the industry and was fortunate enough to work with amazing, experienced professionals that I really felt like I became a mature engineer.

Since then, I've self-learned Rust by writing a [GameBoy emulator](https://github.com/blorente/RustikGB), worked on a [published scientific paper](http://janvitek.org/pubs/oopsla19b.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A1265%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22Fit%22%7D%5D), and I'm currently doing my dream job of improving [developer tooling](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/) @ [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BLorenteEs).

I feel like like I spent the first 8 years of my career (a large chunk of college too!) repeating the same beginner tutorials _over and over again_, and suddenly meeting the right people allowed me to level up, to go **from beginner to professional** in a very short while.

This is all thanks to having found amazing mentors that helped me grow. I wish everybody could have the same opportunity.

Good mentors don't teach you concepts about programming, good mentors teach you **how to think** about programming, how to **focus on what matters**, and how to implement **better solutions, faster**.

This blog is my attempt to capture some of that wisdom, to crystallize the lessons I've learned through mentorship and experience.

If you're a beginner eager to **start thinking like a professional**, I hope you find this blog useful. Read, comment, ask questions, keep practicing and ask more questions. I'll do my best to help.

If you're an experienced developer, please **disagree with what I say**. I'm only at the beginning of my own path, and always looking for advice and feedback.
