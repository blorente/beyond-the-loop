My name is Borja, and I'm passionate about becoming the best programmer I can be.

If you're like me, and are eager to level up as an engineer, this blog is for you.

I've always loved programming. I even studied Computer Science at university.

However, it wasn't until I joined the working world and was fortunate enough to work with amazing, experienced professionals that I really felt like I became a mature engineer.

Since then, self-learned Rust by writing a [GameBoy emulator](https://github.com/blorente/RustikGB), worked on a [published scientific paper](http://janvitek.org/pubs/oopsla19b.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A1265%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22Fit%22%7D%5D), and I'm currently doing my dream job of improving [developer tooling](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/) @ [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BLorenteEs).

This is all thanks to having found amazing mentors that helped me grow. I wish everybody could have the same opportunity.

It's like I spent the first 8 years of my career (a large chunk of college too!) repeating the same beginner tutorials over and over again, and suddenly meeting the right people allowed me to level up, to go from beginner to professional in a very short while.

I believe that getting good mentorship is the single most important thing one can do to skyrocket growth as a programmer.

I don't think there are enough good mentors out there, so this blog is my contribution to bridge the gap, so that I can pass on some of that wisdom that I'm so grateful to have gotten.

If you're a beginner eager to level up, I hope you find this blog useful. Read, ask questions, keep practicing and ask more questions. I'll do my best to help.

If you're an experienced developer, please disagree with what I say. I'm only at the beginning of my own path, and always looking for advice and feedback.
