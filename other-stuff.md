### [Brain.fm](https://brain.fm/invite/AE0QQx3W0K)

Brain.fm is, hands down, **the best thing to have on my headphoones while I'm coding**. It's an endless suppy of (generated) music that is just fast enough to enhance my focus, but not so much as to distract me. The fastest (and most reliable) way to get myself in "the zone" for coding.

That's it. It does one thing. But it does it so damn well.

The yearly subscription has paid for itself several times over in increased productiviy.
